    <p><strong>Major Professional Revamp of Legend Mod & Clan Websites:</strong></p>
    <p>We are excited to announce a substantial update across our primary web platforms. The <strong>Legend Clan
            Hub</strong> (Lc.html) and <strong>Legend Mod</strong> homepage have been transformed with state-of-the-art
        aesthetics and improved functionality.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights of the Update:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified Design System:</strong> Implementation of a premium "Glassmorphism" theme across the Clan
            Hub, featuring frosted transparency and vibrant accents.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinematic Animations:</strong> Added smooth "fadeInUp" entrance transitions for every section to
            create a modern, app-like feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard Refinement:</strong> The "Clan Latest" and "Clan Details" sections have been unified with
            a sleek purple highlight design.</li>
        <li><strong>Member List & Admins Updated:</strong> The clan roster and administrative team sections have been
            updated with the latest roles and professional styling.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Legacy Restoration:</strong> We have brought back the full timeline of 15 major
            historical news items in the newsfeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Homepage Polishing:</strong> Fixed the broken promo video in the "About" section and updated author
            credentials with direct GitHub links.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These updates ensure that the Legend Clan legacy is preserved in a modern, high-end digital environment.
