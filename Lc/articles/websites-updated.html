    <p><strong>Major Professional Revamp of Legend Mod & Clan Websites:</strong></p>
    <p>We are excited to announce a substantial update across our primary web platforms. The <strong>Legend Clan
            Hub</strong> (available via <a href="http://join.lc" target="_blank">join.lc</a>) and the <strong>Legend
            Mod</strong> official site (<a href="http://www.legendmod.ml" target="_blank">www.legendmod.ml</a>) have
        been transformed with state-of-the-art
        aesthetics and improved functionality.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Highlights of the Update:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified Design System:</strong> Implementation of a premium "Glassmorphism" theme across the Clan
            Hub, featuring frosted transparency and vibrant accents.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinematic Animations:</strong> Added smooth "fadeInUp" entrance transitions for every section to
            create a modern, app-like feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Dashboard Refinement:</strong> The "Clan Latest" and "Clan Details" sections have been unified with
            a sleek purple highlight design.</li>
        <li><strong>Member List & Admins Updated:</strong> The clan roster and administrative team sections have been
            updated with the latest roles and professional styling.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Legacy Restoration:</strong> We have brought back the full timeline of 15 major
            historical news items in the newsfeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Homepage Polishing:</strong> Fixed the broken promo video in the "About" section and updated author
            credentials with direct GitHub links.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The Future of Legend Mod: Official Chrome Extension</strong></p>
    <p>We are thrilled to announce that we are officially transitioning <strong>Legend Mod</strong> into a standalone
        <strong>Chrome Extension</strong>! Currently awaiting approval from Google, this major shift will eliminate the
        traditional difficulties of using Tampermonkey and manual scripts. We will soon be able to enjoy a seamless,
        "one-click" installation directly from the Chrome Web Store.
    </p>

    <p>For those who want to get a head start, we invite you to download the <strong>Legend Express Extension</strong>
        early.
        <strong>Important:</strong> You must <strong>disable Legend Mod on Tampermonkey</strong> to use this extension
        correctly until we receive official approval.

    <p><strong>Driven by Our Ideology:</strong></p>
    <p>These updates are more than just technical—they reflect our core ideology of unity, loyalty, and the pursuit of
        excellence. We continue to evolve while staying true to our roots as a syndicate.</p>

    <p><strong>A Heartfelt Update:</strong></p>
    <p>On a more personal note, we haven't received any new updates yet regarding whether **Jan (Junky)** is still in
        the hospital. We all continue to pray for his health and well-being, wishing him a full and speedy recovery. We
        are thinking of you, Jan—stay strong and we hope to see you back with us soon!</p>

    <p>These updates ensure that the Legend Clan legacy is preserved in a modern, high-end digital environment.
        <em>Elite design for an elite syndicate.</em>
