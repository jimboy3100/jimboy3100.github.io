    <p>Announcement to all Lc Players:</p>

    <p>
      Today, 17 December 2025, Lc completed a member vote and selected three new candidates to advance toward full membership:
      <br>℄🌀SᗩᗰᗩᑎTᕼᗩ👻NL
      <br>℄🌀NUCLEARAIN TI
      <br>℄🌀𝓡𝓲𝓰𝓮𝓵
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a “quick tag”. Lc means Legend Clan, and the name must be carried with discipline.
      New members are not recruited to fill numbers; they are earned through presence, consistency, and contribution.
      This is how we keep the identity strong—this is how Lc evolves into a stronger, sharper era: an Lc “version 2” built on loyalty, stamina, and standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      After so many years, our community continues to stand active and united. Many clans appeared and disappeared.
      Lc remains here—alive and strong—because we protect the culture: respect inside the clan, effort in battles, and responsibility in communication.
      If anyone claims “oldest clan” as a title, it must be backed by actions every day, not words.
    </p>

    <p>
      The outmost important thing for Lc is to keep members as rocks—players who do not leave when it gets hard, who do not disappear when the hype ends,
      and who do not forget what the symbol represents. For this reason, Lc membership is voted and earned over time:
      candidates wait, prove stability, and build trust before they become members. That waiting is not punishment; it is the filter that protects Lc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Candidates: your responsibility now is simple and strict:
      <br>1) Be present with Lc, not only when it benefits you.
      <br>2) Train, adapt, and build stamina—mentally and in-game.
      <br>3) Show respect to every real Lc player and follow the clan structure.
      <br>4) Earn trust through consistency. The clan goes first.
    </p>

    <p>
      To all members: support the candidates, test them fairly, and judge them by loyalty and endurance—never by drama.
      If we keep the standards high, Lc stays Lc.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Lc belongs to the players who believed in Lc." Clan goes first.
