    <p>Announcement to all Lc Players:</p>

    <p>
      Today, 28 December 2025, at 23:25 Cairo time, something happened that many of us never expected to witness so clearly.
      I opened agar.io using Legend Mod and did what I have done for years: I searched for Lc players by typing the ℄ symbol
      on Snez servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was shocking.
      On North America servers, I found only two Lc players online — and they were not actively playing.
      For the first time in many years, I then saw something that used to belong only to the past:
      Experimental servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Europe, North America, South America, Turkey — server after server appeared almost empty.
      The servers with the highest activity showed a maximum of two players.
      Most servers had no players at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      I checked every game mode.
      Party: empty.
      Teams: empty.
      Battle Royale: empty.
      The only mode still standing is FFA — and even that survives under pressure,
      with bots flooding games and frequent server instability and crashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a temporary dip.
      Miniclip is not updating agar.io.
      There are no fixes, no roadmap, no visible effort to stabilize or revive the ecosystem.
      What we are seeing now is the natural outcome of abandonment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agar.io shaped communities, clans, rivalries, and friendships for years.
      Lc grew inside that world and survived because we were never just a game-mode clan.
      We were players bound by loyalty, discipline, and continuity — not by numbers on a server list.
    </p>

    <p>
      If one day agar.io stops functioning completely, this should not catch us unprepared.
      Games can disappear.
      Servers can shut down.
      What matters is whether the people behind the tag are ready for that moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be ready.
      Stay connected.
      Remember that Lc was never defined by Miniclip, servers, or modes.
      Lc exists because players carry it — not because a game allows it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>But whatever the outcome, remember Neo.
      Sooner or later you are going to realize,
      just as I did,
      that there is difference between
      knowing the path,
        ... and walking the path.
      ℄ Legend Clan.
