        <p>Special Announcement to all Lc Players:</p>

        <p>
            Over the last week, a clear and undeniable change has been observed in player behavior.
            This absence is not seasonal.
            Players are not staying away due to holidays.
            They are staying away because agar.io is being abandoned.
        </p>

        <p>
            When issues are reported to Miniclip, there is no human response.
            Only scripted, automated replies return — if anything returns at all.
            It feels like sending a signal into space, with no one listening anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cost cuts and long-term mismanagement have wasted what was once a thriving game.
            The focus shifted years ago:
            not value for players, but players for revenue.
            The result is now visible, server by server.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, players are also staying away due to a sharp increase in active botters.
            Bots are now present in almost every room.
            What was once sparse has become common.
            Fair play is damaged, trust is broken, and real players quietly leave.
        </p>

        <p>
            If this is the new normal, then it is understandable why people are packing their bags and leaving —
            not out of spite, but to send a signal.
            A signal that rules, once agreed upon, must be enforced.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fair play, prohibition of cheating and exploits, protection against inappropriate language and content,
            prevention of personal data abuse, and the banning of account selling or sharing —
            these are not optional promises.
            They are the foundation of any online platform that claims legitimacy.
        </p>

        <p>
            When rules exist but nobody abides by them,
            and enforcement never comes,
            the result is inevitable.
            It becomes a one-way street down the drain for any gaming platform.
            That moment feels like a door being shut in your face by the company itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite all unanswered efforts, Legend knows what it is capable of —
            even if Miniclip does not.
            Lc did not exist because it was allowed to.
            Lc exists because players carry it.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will fight till the end.
            Not just for ourselves,
            but as a service to those who still acknowledge the true value of playing online together —
            with discipline, respect, and a no-nonsense attitude, as close to purity as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
