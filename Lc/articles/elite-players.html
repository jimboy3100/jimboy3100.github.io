<p>We recruit the the best players and we keep them as recruiters, we train them in strategy, we give them the tools. They become members after a period of testing if they have the standards. All members are elite.</p>
<p>New recruits have to understand that their main role is to be splitters on clan wars. They must be level 60 or higher and&nbsp;be possessed by spirit of cooperation. Mod/Extension we use is <a title="Legend Mod Website" href="http://www.legendmod.ml" target="_blank">Legend Mod</a> for the game.</p>
<p>We also give them other tools, teach them game strategy and give them catholic strategicly commands in order to win. Rules must be executed by all, also there are no "egos" between elite players...</p>
